# JsFormValidation
Validating a Form using Javascript. Also alerting the Input the user puts in. 
This is basically a form that receives a books title from the user, the books author , the year the book was published and the ISBN number.
The validation ensures that no input box is submitted empty.
Only numbers are accepted within the ISBN input box.
No year beyond 2017 will be accepted.
By the way, Internal Javascript has been used in this project because the code was considered not too bulky.
